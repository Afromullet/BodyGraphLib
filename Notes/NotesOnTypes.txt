Below is a short explanation of the classes/types used in BodyGraphLib


_______________________________________

-AnatomyGraph

This is a graph of BodyParts. A vertex is a bodypart, and an edge is a connection between bodyparts. 


_______________________________________

-Material

Every Item has a material. Materials can be deformed of fractured, so they have a deformation and fracture strength (Dwarf Fortress Inspiured)
The material strength determines how a force effects the material. There's a fracture and a deformation strength, and the force applied to a material
uses those strenghts to determine how the material is morphed
_______________________________________

-ApplyingForce and ResistingForce

An ApplyingForce is a force applied to a Material or BodyPart.
A ResistingForce is the kind of resistance a material to the ApplyingForce applied to it

-Item->Armor

_______________________________________

-ArmorLayer

Represents a layer of Armor. A bodypart has a layer of armor. This is so that, for example, we can have leather armor uner chain mail.

An ApplyingForce can be applied to an ArmorLayer, which determines how the material of the armor absorb it.  
This produces an AppliedForceEffect (type explained later in the document) for each layer. 


_____________________________________
-BodyParts

The vertex of an AnatomyGraph. This has an ArmorLayer and a WoundHandler.

The ArmorLayer is the armor covering the BodyPart, and the WoundHandler handles all of the wounds applied to the bodypart.

-AppliedForceType and MaterialEffectType

This is inspired by dwarf fortress. The AppliedForceType has "the kinds of forces that are applied", primarily by an attack.
The MaterialEffectType is the kind of effect on a Material that force caused.

For example, there is a shear force (AppliedForceType), which can cause a shear deformation or shear fracture effect.

A force is applied to a material, and the material can absorb some of that force. A material has a deformation and a fracture strength.
The remaining force, after force absorption, is used to determine whether we have a deformatio or fracture effect, or no effect 
(If not enough force is left to impact the material)

-WoundTypes and WoundSeverity

The WoundTypes gives us the possible types of wounds that can be caused to a bodypart. WoundSeverity tells us how severe a wound is.

-WoundSeverityPair and -WoundTypeMapping


The WoundSeverityPair is a wound severity level (I.E, light, medium, heavy). It tells us what kind of wound can be caused by that kind of severity.
This will be used by the DamageTraverser (explained later in this document). It lets us know what kind of attack can cause what kind of wounds.
A slashing attack for example would just cause a cut as a low severity wound, but could cause bleeding with a medium wound or dismemberment with a serious wound.
A blunt force attack for example could just cause bruising with a light wound and a fracture with a heavy wound. 

The WoundType mapping is a list of WoundSeverity pairs. It's really meant to just have three elements (light, medium, heavy)

-WoundHandler

-AppliedForceEffect

The most important type/class used when ApplyingForce to a material and a bodypart.

The class holds data that's used in forceCalculations, including the startForce and the endForce (after absorption).
Also the kind of wounds that CAN be applied (not will be applied). This is by containing a WoundTypeMapping

This often appears in the form of a list to deal with the AppliedForce to each layer of armor.

-DamageTraverser and ForceEffectHandler

A DamageTraverser is associated with a "type of attack". A thrust, a slash, a slam. It can even be broken down further, such as
a spear thrust, a sword thrust, etc.

The DamageTraverser determines how the graph is traversed for an attack of that kind. A thrust for example would target internal vertices,
a slash outside vertices, and a blunt attack external and internal. 

An important thing a DamageTraverser does is to Apply a Force to a path (a path being a vector of vertices target by the attack). 
ApplyForceToPath handles all of the force absorption due to armor layers.

It also has a WoundTypeMapping to determine what kind of wounds an attack of this kind can cause. 

It procuces a ForceEffectHandler, explained below. 



ForceEffectHandler handles applying the actual force to the ArmorLayer and the body part wounds. The only way this is currently created is
through a DamageTraverser.

The ForceEffectHandler handles applying the Force to the bodypart, its armorLayers, and the wounds.
